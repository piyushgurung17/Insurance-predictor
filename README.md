Insurance Prediction Model
This repository contains the code for an Insurance Prediction Model developed using Streamlit and a Linear Regression algorithm to predict insurance costs based on features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. The model is trained using a dataset from Kaggle and deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web application.

Project Overview
This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict the insurance premium based on various factors. The primary goal of the project is to understand the influence of different features on the insurance cost and deploy the model to allow users to interact with it in real-time.

Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand patterns and trends.
Linear Regression Model: Used to predict insurance charges based on the features.
Streamlit Deployment: The model is deployed in an interactive web app using Streamlit, allowing users to input their details and get insurance predictions.
Key Libraries Used:
Streamlit: For creating the web application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For building the linear regression model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains various features such as:

Age: Age of the insured person.
Sex: Gender of the insured person.
BMI: Body Mass Index of the insured.
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
Smoker: Whether the person is a smoker or not.
Region: The region in which the insured person resides.
Charges: The target variable, representing the insurance charge.
